# The Concept of Runbooks

Runbooks are dynamic operational blueprints that define and guide every aspect of an AI agent's function. They combine natural language processing, SQL translation, and action execution to provide a comprehensive framework for agents to understand, respond to, and act on enterprise data. This dynamic integration ensures real-time adaptability and precision in executing complex business processes.

By integrating the User's Health Lake, extensive medical knowledge base, and AI Actions within a cohesive runbook framework, Vitality AI allows businesses to have more control over how processes are implemented. The process artifacts serve as the key inputs to create the initial runbooks, aligning the AI's operations with business requirements and ensuring consistency and reliability in execution.
