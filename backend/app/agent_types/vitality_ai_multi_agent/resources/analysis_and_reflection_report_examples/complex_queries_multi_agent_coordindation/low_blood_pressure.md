# **Query Analysis Report From Vitality AI**

## **User Query**

In two of the doctor visits I had last year, my blood pressure was very low, around 105/70. It was also low when today when I checked. Were there any changes across my health history that might explain these low numbers?

## **Agent Specialists Consulted**

Lab Technician, Pharmacist, Health Coach

## **Executive Summary**

The analysis indicates that there were no recorded blood pressure readings in the lab results for the year 2023. However, your medication history reveals the use of prednisone, diclofenac, and metformin, which can influence blood pressure levels. Prednisone, in particular, can cause fluctuations in blood pressure. Additionally, your high levels of cardiovascular exercise, such as running and walking, can contribute to lower blood pressure readings. Regular monitoring and consultation with your healthcare provider are recommended to manage and understand these low blood pressure readings.

## **Integrated Analysis & Key Insights**

### **Insights and Correlations**

- **Medication Impact:** Prednisone, used intermittently throughout the year, can cause fluid retention and increase blood pressure. Upon discontinuation, it can lead to a drop in blood pressure. Diclofenac, an NSAID, can also influence blood pressure but to a lesser extent.
- **Physical Activity:** High levels of cardiovascular exercise, such as running and walking, are known to improve heart health and can lead to lower blood pressure. Your fitness data shows significant engagement in these activities.

### **Contextual Analysis**

Considering your medication history and high physical activity levels, both factors likely contribute to your observed low blood pressure readings. The intermittent use of prednisone, in particular, can cause fluctuations in blood pressure, while regular cardiovascular exercise can naturally lower blood pressure.

### **Health Implications**

The combined effects of your medications and high physical activity levels suggest that your low blood pressure readings are influenced by these factors. It is important to monitor these readings regularly and consult with your healthcare provider to ensure they remain within a healthy range.

### **Preventive Measures and Recommendations**

1.  **Monitor Blood Pressure Regularly:** Continue to monitor your blood pressure regularly, especially when starting or stopping medications like prednisone.
2.  **Consult Healthcare Provider:** Discuss the observed low blood pressure readings with your healthcare provider. They may consider adjusting your medication regimen or investigating other potential causes.
3.  **Balanced Exercise Routine:** Maintain a balanced exercise routine that includes a mix of cardiovascular activities (running, walking, cycling) and strength training (core workouts).
4.  **Hydration and Nutrition:** Ensure you are staying hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet, as these factors can also influence blood pressure levels.
5.  **Medication Review:** Periodically review your medications with your healthcare provider to ensure they are still necessary and to adjust dosages as needed.

By understanding the potential impacts of your medications and physical activity on blood pressure, you can better manage and anticipate changes in your health.
