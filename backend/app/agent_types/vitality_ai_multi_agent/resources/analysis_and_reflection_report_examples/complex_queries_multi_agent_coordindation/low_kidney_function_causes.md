# **Query Analysis Report From Vitality AI**

## **User Query**

I've been tracking my liver function tests and noticed they've been higher than usual for most of last year. Can you take a detailed look into my health data for the first 10 months of last year to explain these changes? Please provide a succinct summary of my liver tests during this period and explore all potential factors (keep it short) that could be influencing these results.

## **Agent Specialists Consulted**

Lab Technician, Pharmacist, Health Coach

## **Executive Summary**

During the first 10 months of 2023, your liver function tests (LFTs) showed elevated levels, particularly in AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase). These elevations could be influenced by medications such as prednisone and diclofenac, high physical activity levels, and other factors like diet, hydration, and alcohol consumption. Regular monitoring and consultation with your healthcare provider are recommended to manage and mitigate these elevations.

## **Integrated Analysis & Key Insights**

### **Insights and Correlations**

- **Liver Function Tests:** Elevated AST and ALT levels were observed, indicating potential liver stress or damage.
- **Medications:** Prednisone and diclofenac, used during this period, are known to potentially elevate liver enzymes.
- **Physical Activity:** High levels of running, walking, and core workouts could contribute to muscle stress, influencing liver enzyme levels.

### **Contextual Analysis**

Considering your medication history, physical activity levels, and potential lifestyle factors, these elements collectively contribute to the observed liver enzyme elevations. Prednisone and diclofenac are particularly notable for their potential impact on liver function.

### **Health Implications**

The combined use of medications like prednisone and diclofenac, along with high physical activity, suggests a multifactorial influence on liver enzyme levels. Monitoring liver function and adjusting medication or activity levels may help manage these elevations.

### **Preventive Measures and Recommendations**

1.  **Monitor Liver Function:** Continue regular liver function tests to track changes.
2.  **Review Medications:** Discuss with your healthcare provider the necessity and duration of prednisone and diclofenac use.
3.  **Adjust Physical Activity:** Consider moderating workout intensity to reduce muscle stress.
4.  **Nutrition and Hydration:** Maintain a balanced diet and proper hydration.
5.  **Consult Healthcare Provider:** Schedule a follow-up to discuss these findings and any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

By addressing these factors, you can better manage your liver health while maintaining an active lifestyle.
