# **Query Analysis Report From Vitality AI**

## **User Query**

I recently started taking Ibuprofen for my headaches, Are there any potential interactions with this and my current medications I should be aware of? Analyze ibuprofen thoroughly.

## **Agent Specialists Consulted**

Pharmacist, Lab Technician

## **Executive Summary**

The analysis indicates that while most of your current medications do not have significant interactions with Ibuprofen, there are notable concerns with Rosuvastatin, Ezetimibe, Metformin, Nebivolol, and Diclofenac. Ibuprofen can potentially affect kidney function, which is crucial to monitor in patients taking Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe. Additionally, Ibuprofen can increase the risk of lactic acidosis when taken with Metformin and reduce the effectiveness of Nebivolol in controlling blood pressure. Concurrent use of other NSAIDs like Diclofenac should be avoided due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. Regular monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure is recommended.

## **Findings**

**Pharmacist Findings:**

- **Summary:** Based on your current medications and the addition of Ibuprofen for your headaches, here are the potential interactions you should be aware of:
- **Key Findings and Insights:**
  - **Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe:** Ibuprofen can increase the risk of kidney damage when taken with statins like Rosuvastatin and cholesterol absorption inhibitors like Ezetimibe.
  - **Metformin:** Ibuprofen can potentially increase the risk of lactic acidosis when taken with Metformin.
  - **Nebivolol:** Ibuprofen may reduce the antihypertensive effects of Nebivolol, potentially leading to increased blood pressure.
  - **Diclofenac:** Both Ibuprofen and Diclofenac are NSAIDs, and taking them together can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.
  - **Glycopyrrolate:** There are no significant interactions between Ibuprofen and Glycopyrrolate.
  - **Finasteride, Vitamin D3, and Folic Acid:** There are no significant interactions between Ibuprofen and these medications.

**Lab Technician Findings:**

- **Summary:** Based on your recent lab results and current medications, there are some important considerations regarding the use of Ibuprofen, especially in conjunction with Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe.
- **Key Findings and Insights:**
  - **Creatinine Levels:** Elevated creatinine levels can indicate reduced kidney function. Both Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe can affect kidney health, making it essential to monitor these levels closely.
  - **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** Elevated BUN levels can also indicate kidney stress or dysfunction, which is a concern when taking medications like Ibuprofen and Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe.
  - **eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** The eGFR values are within the normal range but on the lower side, indicating that kidney function should be closely monitored.

## **Integrated Analysis & Key Insights**

- **Insights and Correlations:** Combining the insights from the Lab Technician and Pharmacist, the following key points emerge:
  - **Kidney Function:** Both the Lab Technician and Pharmacist highlight the importance of monitoring kidney function due to the potential impact of Ibuprofen and Rosuvastatin/Ezetimibe on renal health.
  - **Blood Pressure:** The Pharmacist notes that Ibuprofen can reduce the effectiveness of Nebivolol, a beta-blocker used to control blood pressure. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is recommended.
  - **Concurrent NSAID Use:** The Pharmacist advises against taking Ibuprofen and Diclofenac together due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal issues and kidney damage.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Considering your age, gender, and current health status, regular monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function is crucial to manage potential risks.
- **Health Implications:** The combined use of Ibuprofen with your current medications requires careful management to avoid adverse effects on blood pressure and kidney function.
- **Preventive Measures and Recommendations:**
  - **Monitor Blood Pressure:** Regularly check your blood pressure to ensure it remains within the target range.
  - **Kidney Function Tests:** Schedule regular kidney function tests to monitor any potential impact from Ibuprofen.
  - **Avoid Concurrent NSAID Use:** Do not take Diclofenac and Ibuprofen together.
  - **Consult Healthcare Provider:** Discuss these potential interactions with your healthcare provider to ensure safe and effective use of your medications.
  - **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure adequate hydration to support kidney function and reduce the risk of kidney damage from medications.
  - **Monitor for Symptoms:** Be vigilant for any symptoms of kidney dysfunction and report them to your healthcare provider immediately.
